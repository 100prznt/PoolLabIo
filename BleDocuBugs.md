## Page 8:
Commandlist is incomplete.

### Missing commands:
        /// <summary>
        /// Increase PoolLab's LCD contrast by 1 level.
        /// </summary>
        PCMD_API_SET_CONTRAST_PLUS = 0x08,
        /// <summary>
        /// Decrease PoolLabÂ®'s LCD contrast by 1 level.
        /// </summary>
        PCMD_API_SET_CONTRAST_MINUS = 0x09,
        /// <summary>
        /// Read device unit configuration.
        /// </summary>
        PCMD_API_GET_PPM_MGL = 0x0A,
        /// <summary>
        /// Set device unit configuration.
        /// </summary>
        PCMD_API_SET_PPM_MGL = 0x0B

## Page 20:
Wrong command name: "PCMD_API_GET_PPM_MGL"
Should be more like this: "PCMD_API_SET_PPM_MGL"

## Page 21 and 22
Inconsistent result units and ranges.

The unit specified here is always ppm. However, the PoolLAB can also be changed to mg/l. Does the unit then not equal the selected setting?

### Total Chlorine (id 1) and Total Chlorine (liquid) (id 2)
* Different units for same paramter? Cl2 vs. tCl
* Result range of Total Chlorine (id 1) only up to 0.6?

### Total Hardness (id 35) and Calcium (id 23)
* Same result unit for different parameters, CaCO3 (ppm)?
